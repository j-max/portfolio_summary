Project Name: Three Year Recidivism in Iowa Penal System |[repo](https://github.com/j-max/recidivism)
====================
## Skills showcased  
1. Data exploration and cleaning
- [eda.py](https://github.com/j-max/recidivism/blob/master/eda/eda.py) exploring the different categorical variables present in the dataset.
- The file imports [functions](https://github.com/j-max/recidivism/tree/master/data) which bin the various groups to make the models simpler and more interpretable
2. Storing a relational database on an AWS EC2 instance; sql alchemy; postgres implementation [here](https://github.com/j-max/recidivism/blob/master/data/aws_connection.ipynb)  
3. Statistical Inference
- [chi_squared tests](https://github.com/j-max/recidivism/blob/master/eda/hypothesis_test.py): tests for various categorical variables in the dataset
- [logistic regression](https://github.com/j-max/recidivism/blob/master/modeling/best_model.py): Chosen for interpretability of model. Also see end of [README.md](https://github.com/j-max/recidivism)
4. Statistical Modeling
- [logistic regression](https://github.com/j-max/recidivism/blob/master/modeling/best_model.py)
5. [Machine learning methods](https://github.com/j-max/recidivism/tree/master/modeling)
- KNN/Random Forest/Logistic/XGBoost/SVC [here](https://github.com/j-max/recidivism/blob/master/modeling/smaller_model.py)
- SMOTE/KFolds/Pipelines [here](https://github.com/j-max/recidivism/blob/master/modeling/model_oversample.py)
6. Supplemental packages:
- [Statsmodels](https://github.com/j-max/recidivism/blob/master/modeling/logistic_for_p.py)
